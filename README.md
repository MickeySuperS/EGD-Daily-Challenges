# EGD-Daily-Challenges

EGD (Egypt Game Developer) Daily Challenge is an idea inspired by [Donia Mohamed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donia-mohamed-abdelrahim)'s 120 day programming challenge.

It's main goal is to engage more people and grow together as a game developer community.

Feel free to [join EGD server](https://egyptgamedevs.com/discord) and say hi

In each challenge, I will try to provide the source code and a project zip file to download it without cloning the whole repo.

Let me know if there is something I can help with ðŸ‘€
